  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started at IBM I knew how to alter Javascript and compile it. This is because of my many years playing Minecraft (yes I am a nerd). Now I have leveled up! I can understand and use Bash, Assembly, Python, Ruby and C! Writing full programs in any of these languages is a very difficult prospect but none the less achievable with what I know now. Whereas two weeks ago it would have been impossible. Working here even for a short time has been an amazing Learning experience for me, plus it looks great on a resume! Learning how to write C has been one of the most useful things I have learnt. I have already written programs for use both in and out of IBM. The first program I wrote was the standard newbie 'hello world' exercise. I have now expanded on that program so that it now says, "Hello world! This is Callum Scarvell". This is done using strings that recognise my name as a set character. Then I used a header file called conio.h or curses.h to recognise 'cal' as the short form of my name. This is so now I can abbreviate my name easier. Heres what the code looks like:</p>

<p>The last two lines have been left out to make it a challenge to recreate. Feel free to test your own knowledge of C to finish the program! My ultimate goal for this program is to make it generate the text 'Hello World! This is Callum Scarvell's computer. Everybody else beware!'(which is easy) then import it into the Linux kernel to the profile login screen. Then I will have my own unique copy of the kernel. And I could call myself an LSD(Linux system developer). That's just a small pet project I have been working on in my time here. Another pet project of mine is my own very altered copy of the open source game NetHack. It's written in C as well and is very easy to tinker with. I have been able to do things like set my characters starting hit points to 40, give my character awesome starting gear and keep save files even after the death of a character. These are just a couple small projects that made learning C so much easier and a lot more fun. And the whole time I was learning C, Ruby, or Python I had some of the best system developers in the world showing me the ropes. This made things even easier, and much more comprehensive. So really its no surprise that in three short weeks I managed to learn almost four different languages and how to run a blog from the raw source code. The knowledge given to me by the OzLabs team is priceless and invaluable. I will forever remember all the new faces and what they taught me. And the <em>Linux Gods</em> will answer your prayers whether e-mail or in person because they walk among us! So if you ever get an opportunity to do work experience, internship or a graduate placement take the chance to do it because you will learn many things that are not taught in school.</p>
<p>If you would like to reveiw the source code for the blog or my work in general you can find me at <a href="https://github.com/CallumScar">CallumScar.github.com</a> or find me on facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/callum.scarvell/about">Callum Scarvell</a>. </p>
<p>And a huge thankyou to the OzLabs team for taking me on for the three weeks and for teaching me so much! I am forever indebted to everyone here.   </p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a recent year twelve graduate my knowledge of computer science was very limited and my ability to write working programs was all but none. So you can imagine my excitement when I heard of an opening for work experience with IBM's internationally renowned Ozlabs team, or as I knew them the <em>Linux Gods</em>. My first day of working at Ozlabs I learnt more about programing then in six years of secondary education. I met most of the Ozlabs team and made connections that will certainly help with my pursuit of a career in IT. Because in business its who you know more than what you know, and now I know the guys at Ozlabs I know how to write code and run it on my own Linux Distro. And on top of all the extremely valuable knowledge I am on a first name basis with the <em>Linux Gods</em> at the LTC.</p>
<p>After my first week at Ozlabs I cloned this blog from Octopress and reformatted it for pelican static site generator.For those who don't know Octopress is a ruby based static site generator so converting the embedded ruby gems to pelicans python code was no easy task for this newbie. Luckily I had a team of some of the best software developers in the world to help and teach me their ways. After we sorted the change from ruby to python and I was able to understand both languages, I presented my work to the team. They then decided to throw me a curve ball as they did not like any of pelicans default themes, instead they wanted the original Octopress theme on the new blog. This is how I learnt GitHub is my bestest friend, because some kind soul had already converted the ruby theme into python and it ran perfectly!</p>
<p>Now it was a simple task of re-formatting the ruby-gem text files into markdown which is pelican compatible(which is why we chose pelican in the first place). So now we had a working pelican blog on the Octopress theme, one issue it was very annoying to navigate. Using my newly learned skills and understanding of python I inserted tags, categories, web-links, navigation bar and I started learning how to code C. And it all worked fine! That was what I a newbie could accomplish in one week. I still have two more weeks left here and I have plenty of really interesting work left to do. This has been one of the greatest learning experiences of my life and I would do it again if I could! So if you are looking for experience in it or software development look no further because you could be learning to code from the people who wrote the language itself.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a tale of a simple problem, with a relatively simple solution, that ended up being pretty complicated.</p>
<p>The BMC of OpenPOWER machines expose a serial console.  It's pretty useful for getting information as the system is booting, or when it's having issues and the network is down.  OpenPOWER machines also have runtime firmware, namely <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">skiboot</a>, which the Linux kernel calls to make certain things happen.  One of those is writing to the serial console.  There's a function that <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/blob/master/core/opal.c">skiboot exposes</a>, <code>opal_poll_events()</code> (which then calls <code>opal_run_pollers()</code>), which the kernel calls frequently.  Among other things, it performs a partial flush of the serial console.  And that all works fine...until the kernel panics.</p>
<p>Well, the kernel is in panic.  Who cares if it flushes the console?  It's dead.  It doesn't need to do anything else.</p>
<p>Oh, right.  It prints the reason it panicked.  Turns out that's pretty useful.</p>
<p>There's a pretty simple fix here that we can push into the firmware.  Most kernels are configured to reboot after panic, typically with some delay.  In OpenPOWER, the kernel reboots by calling into skiboot with the <code>opal_cec_reboot()</code> function.  So all we need to do is flush out the console buffer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">int64</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">opal_cec_reboot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;OPAL: Reboot request...</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">console_complete_flush</span><span class="p">();</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// &lt;-- what I added</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="c1">// rebooting stuff happens here...</span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">OPAL_SUCCESS</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Writing a complete flushing function was pretty easy, then call it from the power down and reboot functions.  Easy, all nicely contained in firmware.</p>
<p>Now, what if the kernel isn't configured to reboot after panic.  Or, what if the reboot timer is really long?  Do you want to wait 3 minutes to see your panic output?  Probably not.  We need to call the pollers after panic.</p>
<p>First, I had to figure out what the kernel actually <em>does</em> when it panics.  Let's have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/panic.c">panic function itself</a> to figure out where we could work some code in.</p>
<p>In the <code>panic()</code> function, the easiest place I found to put in some code was <code>panic_blink()</code>.  This is supposed to be a function to blink the LEDs on your keyboard when the kernel is panicking, but we could set it to <code>opal_poll_events()</code> and it'd work fine.  There, problem solved!</p>
<p>Oh, wait.  That will never get accepted upstream, ever.  Let's try again.</p>
<p>Well, there are <code>#ifdef</code>s in the code that are architecture specific, for s390 and SPARC.  I could add an <code>#ifdef</code> to check if we're an OpenPOWER machine, and if so, run the pollers a bunch of times.  That would also involve including architecture specific code from <code>arch/powerpc</code>, and that's somewhat gross.  Maybe I could upstream this, but it'd be difficult.  There must be a better way.</p>
<p>As a kernel noob, I found myself digging into what every function called by <code>panic()</code> actually did, to see if there's a way I could use it.  I looked over it at first, but eventually I started looking harder at this line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="w">    </span><span class="n">kmsg_dump</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">KMSG_DUMP_PANIC</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It turns out <code>kmsg_dump()</code> does what it says: dumps messages from the kernel.  Different parts of the kernel can register their own dumpers, so the kernel can have a variety of dumpers for different purposes.  One existing example in OpenPOWER is a kmsg dumper that stores messages in <code>nvram</code> (non-volatile RAM), so you can find it after you reboot.</p>
<p>Well, we don't really want to dump any output, it's already been sent to the output buffer.  We just need to flush it.  Pretty simple, just call <code>opal_poll_events()</code> a whole bunch of times, right?  That <em>would</em> work, though it'd be nice to have a better way than just calling the pollers.  Instead, we can add a new API call to skiboot specifically for console flushing, and call it from the kmsg dumper.</p>
<p>Initially, I wired up the skiboot complete console flushing function to a new OPAL API call, and called that from the kernel.  After some feedback, this was refactored into a partial, incremental flush so it was more generic.  I also had to consider what happened if the machine was running a newer kernel and an older skiboot, so if the skiboot version didn't have my new flushing call it would fall back to calling the pollers an arbitrary amount of times.</p>
<p>In the end, it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Console output is controlled by OPAL firmware.  The kernel regularly calls</span>
<span class="cm"> * OPAL_POLL_EVENTS, which flushes some console output.  In a panic state,</span>
<span class="cm"> * however, the kernel no longer calls OPAL_POLL_EVENTS and the panic message</span>
<span class="cm"> * may not be completely printed.  This function does not actually dump the</span>
<span class="cm"> * message, it just ensures that OPAL completely flushes the console buffer.</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous life I tutored first year computing. The university I
attended had a policy of using C to introduce first years to programming.
One of the most rewarding aspects of teaching is opening doors of
possibility to people by sharing my knowledge.</p>
<p>Over the years I had a mixture of computer science or computer engineering
students as well as other disciplines of engineering who were required to
learn the basics (notably electrical and mechanical). Each class was
different and the initial knowledge always varied greatly. The beauty of
teaching C meant that there was never someone who truly knew it all, heck,
I didn't and still don't. The other advantage of teaching C is that I could
very quickly spot the hackers, the shy person at the back of the room who's
eyes light up when you know you've correctly explained pointers (to them
anyway) or when asked "What happens if you use a negative index into an
array" and the smile they would make upon hearing "What do you think happens".</p>
<p>Right there I would see the makings of a hacker, and this post is dedicated
to you or to anyone who wants to be a hacker. I've been asked "What did you
do to get where you are?", "How do I get into Linux?" (vague much) at
careers fairs. I never quite know what to say, here goes a braindump.</p>
<p>Start with the basics, one of the easiest way we tested the first years was
to tell them they can't use parts of libc. That was a great exam, taking
aside those who didn't read the question and used <code>strlen()</code> when they were
explicitly told they couldn't <code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</code> a true hacker doesn't
need libc, understand it won't always be there. I thought of this example
because only two weeks ago I was writing code in an environment where I
didn't have libc. Ok sure, if you've got it, use it, just don't crumble
when you don't. Oh how I wish I could have told those students who argued
that it was a pointless question that they were objectively wrong.</p>
<p>Be a fan of assembly, don't be afraid of it, it doesn't bite and it can be
a lot of fun. I wouldn't encourage you to dive right into the PowerISA,
it's intense but perhaps understand the beauty of GCC, know what it's doing
for you. There is a variety of little 8 bit processors you can play with
these days.</p>
<p>At all levels of my teaching I saw almost everyone get something which
'worked', and that's fine, it probably does but I'm here to tell you that
it doesn't work until you know why it works. I'm all for the 'try it and
see' approach but once you've tried it you have to explain why the
behaviour changed otherwise you didn't fix it. As an extension to that,
know how your tools work, I don't think anyone would expect you to be able
to write tools to the level of complexity of GCC or GDB or Valgrind but
have a rough idea as to how they achieve their goals.</p>
<p>A hacker is paranoid, yes, <code>malloc()</code> fails. Linux might just decide now
isn't a good time for you to <code>open()</code> and your <code>fopen()</code> calling function had
better be cool with that. A hacker also doesn't rely on the kindness of the
operating system theres an <code>munmap()</code> for a reason. Nor should you even
completely trust it, what are you leaving around in memory?</p>
<p>Above all do a it for the fun of it, so many of my students asked how I
knew everything I knew (I was only a year ahead of them in my first year of
teaching) and put simply, write code on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>None of these things do or don't make you a hacker, being a hacker is a
frame of mind and a way of thinking but all of the above helps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there isn't a single path, I might even say it is a path that
chooses you. Odds are you're here because you approached me at some point
and asked me one of those questions I never quite know how to answer.
Perhaps this is the path, at the very least you're asking questions and
approaching people. I'm hope I did on the day, but once again, all the very
best with your endeavours into the future</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the cool features of POWER8 processors is the ability to run in either big- or little-endian mode. Several distros are already available in little-endian, but up until recently Petitboot has remained big-endian. While it has no effect on the OS, building Petitboot little-endian has its advantages, such as making support for vendor tools easier.
So it should just be a matter of compiling Petitboot LE right? Well...</p>
<h3>Switching Endianess</h3>
<p>Endianess, and several other things besides, are controlled by the Machine State Register (MSR). Each processor in a machine has an MSR, and each bit of the MSR controls some aspect of the processor such as 64-bit mode or enabling interrupts. To switch endianess we set the LE bit (63) to 1.</p>
<p>When a processor first starts up it defaults to big-endian (bit 63 = 0). However the processor doesn't actually know the endianess of the kernel code it is about to execute - either it is big-endian and everything is fine, or it isn't and the processor will very quickly try to execute an illegal instruction.</p>
<p>The solution to this is an amazing little snippet of code in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/powerpc/boot/ppc_asm.h#L65">arch/powerpc/boot/ppc_asm.h</a> (follow the link to see some helpful commenting):</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>By some amazing coincidence if you take the opcode for <code>tdi 0, 0, 0x48</code> and flip the order of the bytes it forms the opcode for <code>b . + 8</code>. So if the kernel is big-endian, the processor will jump to the next instruction after this snippet. However if the kernel is little-endian we execute the next 8 instructions. These are written in reverse so that if the processor isn't in the right endian it interprets them backwards, executing the instructions shown in the linked comments above, resulting in MSR<sub>LE</sub> being set to 1.</p>
<p>When booting a little-endian kernel all of the above works fine - but there is a problem for Petitboot that will become apparent a little further down...</p>
<h3>Petitboot's Secret Sauce</h3>
<p>The main feature of Petitboot is that it is a full (but small!) Linux kernel and userspace which scans all available devices and presents possible boot options. To boot an available operating system Petitboot needs to start executing the OS's kernel, which it accomplishes via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec</a>. Simply speaking kexec loads the target kernel into memory, shuts the current system down most of the way, and at the last moment sets the instruction pointer to the start of the target kernel. From there it's like booting any other kernel, including the FIXUP_ENDIAN section above.</p>
<h3>We've Booted! Wait...</h3>
<p>So our LE Petitboot kernel boots fine thanks to FIXUP_ENDIAN, we kexec into some other kernel.. and everything falls to pieces.<br>
The problem is we've unwittingly changed one of the assumptions of booting a kernel; namely that MSR<sub>LE</sub> defaults to zero. When kexec-ing from an LE kernel we start executing the next kernel in LE mode. This itself is ok, the FIXUP_ENDIAN macro will handle the switch if needed. The problem is that the FIXUP_ENDIAN macro is relatively recent, first entering the kernel in early 2014. So if we're booting, say, an old Fedora 19 install with a v3.9 kernel - things go very bad, very quickly.</p>
<h3>Fix #1</h3>
<p>The solution seems pretty straightforward: find where we jump into the next kernel, and just before that make sure we reset the LE bit in the MSR. That's exactly what <a href="https://github.com/antonblanchard/kexec-lite/commit/150b14e76a4b51f865b929ad9a9bf4133e2d3af7">this patch</a> to kexec-lite does.<br>
That worked up until I tested on a machine with more than one CPU. Remembering that the MSR is processor-specific, we also have to <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ffebf5f391dfa9da3e086abad3eef7d3e5300249">reset the endianess of each secondary CPU</a><br>
Now things are looking good! All the CPUs are reset to big-endian, the target kernel boots fine, and then... 'recursive interrupts?!'</p>
<h3>HILE</h3>
<p>Skipping the debugging process that led to this (hint: <a href="https://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2014/12/03/running-skiboot-opal-on-the-power8-simulator/">mambo</a> is actually a pretty cool tool), these were the sequence of steps leading up to the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little-endian Petitboot kexecs into a big-endian kernel</li>
<li>All CPUs are reset to big-endian</li>
<li>The big-endian kernel begins to boot successfully</li>
<li>Somewhere in the device-tree parsing code we take an exception</li>
<li>Execution jumps to the exception handler at <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/powerpc/kernel/exceptions-64s.S#L199">0x300</a></li>
<li>I notice that MSR<sub>LE</sub> is set to 1</li>
<li>WHAT WHY IS THE LE BIT IN THE MSR SET TO 1</li>
<li>We fail to read the first instruction at 0x300 because it's written in big-endian, so we jump to the exception handler at 0x300... oh no.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then we very busily execute nothing until the machine is killed. I spend some time staring incredulously at my screen, then appeal to a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/MAINTAINERS">higher authority</a> who replies with "What is the HILE set to?"  </p>
<p>..the WHAT?<br>
Cracking open the <a href="https://www.power.org/documentation/power-isa-v-2-07b/">PowerISA</a> reveals this tidbit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hypervisor Interrupt Little-Endian (HILE) bit is a bit
in an implementation-dependent register or similar
mechanism. The contents of the HILE bit are copied
into MSR<sub>LE</sub> by interrupts that set MSR<sub>HV</sub> to 1 (see Section
6.5), to establish the Endian mode for the interrupt
handler. The HILE bit is set, by an implementation-dependent
method, during system initialization,
and cannot be modified after system initialization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, there are use cases for taking exceptions in a different endianess. The problem is that while HILE gets switched on when setting MSR<sub>LE</sub> to 1, it <em>doesn't</em> get turned off when MSR<sub>LE</sub> is set to zero. In particular the line "...cannot be modified after system initialization." led to a fair amount of hand wringing from myself and whoever would listen; if we can't reset the HILE bit, we simply can't use little-endian kernels for Petitboot.  </p>
<p>Luckily while on some other systems the machinations of the firmware might be a complete black box, Petitboot runs on OPAL systems - which means the firmware source is <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">right here</a>. In particular we can see here the OPAL call to <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/blob/master/core/cpu.c#L702">opal_reinit_cpus</a> which among other things resets the HILE bit.<br>
This is actually what turns on the HILE bit in the first place, and is meant to be called early on in boot since it also clobbers a large amount of state. Luckily for us we don't need to hold onto any state since we're about to jump into a new kernel. We just need to choose an appropriate place where we can be sure we won't take an exception before we get into the next kernel: thus the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/e72bb8a5a884d022231149d407653923a1d79e53">final patch to support PowerNV machines.</a></p></div>
