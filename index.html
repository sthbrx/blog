  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The setup</h2>
<p>I've recently been working on internal CI infrastructure for testing kernels before sending them to the mailing list. As part of this effort, I became interested in <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible builds</a>. Minimising the changing parts outside of the source tree itself could improve consistency and ccache hits, which is great for trying to make the CI faster and more reproducible across different machines. This means removing 'external' factors like timestamps from the build process, because the time changes every build and means the results between builds of the same tree are no longer identical binaries. This also prevents using previously cached results, potentially slowing down builds (though it turns out the kernel does a good job of limiting the scope of where timestamps appear in the build).</p>
<p>As part of this effort, I came across the <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> environment variable. This variable is used to set the kernel timestamp, which is primarily for any users who want to know when their kernel was built. That's mostly irrelevant for our work, so an easy <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP=0</code> later and... it still uses the current date.</p>
<p>Ok, checking <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/kbuild.html#kbuild-build-timestamp">the documentation</a> it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting this to a date string overrides the timestamp used in the UTS_VERSION definition (uname -v in the running kernel). The value has to be a string that can be passed to date -d. The default value is the output of the date command at one point during build.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it looks like the timestamp variable is actually expected to be a date format. To make it obvious that it's not a 'real' date, let's set <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP=0000-01-01</code>. A bunch of zeroes (and the ones to make it a valid month and day) should tip off anyone to the fact it's invalid.</p>
<p>As an aside, this is a different date to what I tried to set it to earlier; a 'timestamp' typically refers to the number of seconds since the UNIX epoch (1970), so my first attempt would have corresponded to 1970-01-01. But given we're passing a date, not a timestamp, there should be no problem setting it back to the year 0. And I like the aesthetics of 0000 over 1970.</p>
<p>Building and booting the kernel, we see <code>#1 SMP 0000-01-01</code> printed as the build timestamp. Success! After confirming everything works, I set the environment variable in the CI jobs and call it a day.</p>
<h2>An unexpected error</h2>
<p>A few days later I need to run the CI to test my patches, and something strange happens. It builds fine, but the boot tests that load a root disk image fail inexplicably: there is a kernel panic saying "VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(253,2)".</p>

<p>This is even more baffling: if it's unable to open a console, then what am I reading these messages on? And error <code>-2</code>, or ENOENT, on opening 'vda2' implies that no such file or directory exists. But it then lists vda2 as a present drive with a known driver? So is vda2 missing or not?</p>
<h2>Living in denial</h2>
<p>As you've read the title of this article, you can probably guess as to what changed to cause this error. But at the time I had no idea what could have been the cause. I'd already confirmed that a kernel with a set timestamp can boot to userspace, and there was another (seemingly) far more likely candidate for the failure: as part of the CI design, patches are extracted from the submitted branch and rebased onto the maintainer's tree. This is great from a convenience perspective, because you don't need to worry about forgetting to rebase your patches before testing and submission. But if the maintainer has synced their branch with Linus' tree it means there could be a lot of things changed in the source tree between runs, even if they were only a few days apart.</p>
<p>So, when you're faced with a working test on one commit and a broken test on another commit, it's time to break out the <code>git bisect</code>. Downloading the kernel images from the relevant CI jobs, I confirmed that indeed one was working while the other was broken. So I bisected the relevant commits, and... everything kept working. Each step I would build and boot the kernel, and each step would reach userspace just fine. I was getting suspicious at this point, so skipped ahead to the known bad commit and built and tested it locally. It <em>also worked</em>.</p>
<p>This was highly confusing, because it meant there was something fishy going on. Some kind of state outside of the kernel tree. Could it be... surely not...</p>
<p>Comparing the boot logs of the two CI kernels, I see that the working one indeed uses an actual timestamp, and the broken one uses the 0000-01-01 fixed date. Oh no. Setting the timestamp with a local build, I can now reproduce the boot panic with a kernel I built myself.</p>
<h2>But... why?</h2>
<p>OK, so it's obvious at this point that the timestamp is affecting loading a root disk somehow. But why? The obvious answer is that it's before the UNIX epoch. Something in the build process is turning the date into an actual timestamp, and going wrong when that timestamp gets used for something.</p>
<p>But it's not like there was a build error complaining about it. As best I could tell, the kernel doesn't try to parse the date anywhere, besides passing it to <code>date</code> during the build. And if <code>date</code> had an issue with it, it would have broken the <em>build</em>. Not <em>booting</em> the kernel. There's no <code>date</code> utility being invoked during kernel boot!</p>
<p>Regardless, I set about tracing the usage of <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> inside the kernel. The stacktrace in the panic gave the end point of the search; the function <code>mount_block_root()</code> wasn't happy. So all I had to do was work out at which point <code>mount_block_root()</code> tried to access the <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> value.</p>
<p>In short, that went nowhere.</p>
<p><code>mount_block_root()</code> effectively just tries to open a file in the filesystem. There's massive amounts of code handling this, and any part could have had the undocumented dependency on <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code>. Approaching from the other direction, <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> is turned into <code>build-timestamp</code> inside a Makefile, which is in turn related to a file <code>include/generated/utsversion.h</code>. This file <code>#define</code>s <code>UTS_VERSION</code> equal to the <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> value. Searching the kernel for <code>UTS_VERSION</code>, we hit <code>init/version-timestamp.c</code> which stores it in a struct with other build information:</p>

<p>This is where the trail goes cold: I don't know if you've ever tried this, but searching for <code>.version</code> in the kernel's codebase is not a very fruitful endeavor when you're interested in a specific kind of version.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ rg &quot;(\.|\-&gt;)version\b&quot; | wc -l
5718
</code></pre></div>

<p>I tried tracing the usage of <code>init_uts_ns</code>, but didn't get very far.</p>
<p>By now I'd already posted this in chat and another developer, <a href="https://shenki.github.io/">Joel Stanley</a>, was also investigating this bizarre bug. They had been testing different timestamp values and made the horrifying discovery that the bug sticks around after a rebuild. So you could start with a broken build, set the timestamp back to the correct value, rebuild, and the resulting kernel would <em>still be broken</em>. The boot log would report the correct time, but the root disk mounter panicked all the same.</p>
<h2>Getting sidetracked</h2>
<p>I wasn't prepared to investigate the boot panic directly until the persistence bug was fixed. Having to run <code>make clean</code> and rebuild everything would take an annoyingly long time, even with ccache. Fortunately, I had a plan. All I had to do was work out which generated files are different between a broken and working build, and binary search by deleting half of them until deleting only one made the difference between the bug persisting or not. We can use <code>diff</code> for this. Running the initial diff we get</p>

<p>Hmm, OK so only some top level files are different. Deleting all the different files doesn't fix the persistence bug though, and I know that a proper <code>make clean</code> does fix it, so what could possibly be the difference when all the remaining files are identical?</p>
<p>Oh wait. <code>man diff</code> reports that <code>diff</code> only compares the top level folder entries by default. So it was literally just telling me "yes, both the broken and working builds have a folder named X". How GNU of it. Re-running the diff command with actually useful options, we get a more promising story</p>

<p>There are some new entries here: notably <code>init/version*</code> and <code>usr/initramfs*</code>. Binary searching these files results in a single culprit: <code>usr/initramfs_data.cpio</code>. This is quite fitting, as the <code>.cpio</code> file is an archive defining a filesystem layout, <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.html?highlight=initramfs#why-cpio-rather-than-tar">much like <code>.tar</code> files</a>. This file is actually embedded into the kernel image, and loaded as a bare-bones shim filesystem when the user doesn't provide their own initramfs<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So it would make sense that if the CPIO archive wasn't being rebuilt, then the initial filesystem wouldn't change. And it would make sense for the initial filesystem to be causing mount issues of the proper root disk filesystem.</p>
<p>This just leaves the question of how <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> is breaking the CPIO archive. And it's around this time that a third developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajdlinux">Andrew</a>, who I'd roped into this bug hunt for having the (mis)fortune to sit next to me, pointed out that the generator script for this CPIO archive was passing the <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> to <code>date</code>. Whoop, we've found the murder weapon<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>!</p>
<p>The persistence bug could be explained now: because the script was only using <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> internally, <code>make</code> had no way of knowing that the archive generation depended on this variable. So even when I changed the variable to a valid value, <code>make</code> didn't know to rebuild the corrupt archive. Let's now get back to the main issue: why boot panics.</p>
<h2>Solving the case</h2>
<p>Following along the CPIO generation script, the <code>KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP</code> variable is turned into a timestamp by <code>date -d"$KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP" +%s</code>. Testing this in the shell with <code>0000-01-01</code> we get this (somewhat amusing, but also painful) result</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>date -d&quot;$KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP&quot; +%s
-62167255492
</code></pre></div>

<p>This timestamp is then passed to a C program that assigns it to a variable <code>default_mtime</code>. Looking over the source, it seems this variable is used to set the <code>mtime</code> field on the files in the CPIO archive. The timestamp is stored as a <code>time_t</code>, which is an alias for <code>int64_t</code>. That's 64 bits of data, up to 16 hexadecimal characters. And yes, that's relevant: CPIO stores the <code>mtime</code> (and all other numerical fields) as 32 bit unsigned integers represented by ASCII hexadecimal characters. The <code>sprintf()</code> call that ultimately embeds the timestamp uses the <code>%08lX</code> format specifier. This formats a <code>long</code> as hexadecimal, padded to at least 8 characters. Hang on... <strong><em>at least</em></strong> 8 characters? What if our timestamp happens to be more?</p>
<p>It turns out that large timestamps are already guarded against. The program will error during build if the date is later than 2106-02-07 (maximum unsigned 8 hex digit timestamp).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Timestamps after 2106-02-07 06:28:15 UTC have an ascii hex time_t</span>
<span class="cm"> * representation that exceeds 8 chars and breaks the cpio header</span>
<span class="cm"> * specification.</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">default_mtime</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mh">0xffffffff</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But we are using an <code>int64_t</code>. What would happen if one were to provide a negative timestamp?</p>
<p>Well, <code>sprintf()</code> happily spits out <code>FFFFFFF1868AF63C</code> when we pass in our negative timestamp representing <code>0000-01-01</code>. That's 16 characters, 8 too many for the CPIO header<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So at last we've found the cause of the panic: the timestamp is being formatted too long, which breaks the CPIO header and the kernel doesn't create an initial filesystem correctly. This includes the <code>/dev</code> folder (which surprisingly is not hardcoded into kernel, but must be declared by the initramfs). So when the root disk mounter tries to open <code>/dev/vda2</code>, it correctly complains that it failed to create a device in the non-existent <code>/dev</code>.</p>
<h2>Postmortem</h2>
<p>After discovering all this, I sent in a couple of patches to fix <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230320040839.660475-1-bgray@linux.ibm.com/">the CPIO generation</a> and <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230320040839.660475-2-bgray@linux.ibm.com/">rebuild logic</a>. They were not complicated fixes, but wow were they time consuming to track down. I didn't see the error initially because I typically only boot with my own initramfs over the embedded one, and not with the intent to load a root disk. Then the panic itself was quite far away from the real issue, and there were many dead ends to explore.</p>
<p>I also got curious as to why the kernel didn't complain about a corrupt initramfs earlier. A brief investigation showed a streaming parser that is <em>extremely</em> fault tolerant, silently skipping invalid entries (like ones missing or having too long a name). The corrupted header was being interpreted as an entry with an empty name and 2 gigabyte body contents, which meant that (1) the kernel skipped inserting it due to the empty name, and (2) the kernel skipped the rest of the initramfs because it thought that up to 2 GB of the remaining content was part of that first entry.</p>
<p>Perhaps this could be improved to require that all input is consumed without unexpected EOF, such as how the userspace <code>cpio</code> tool works (which, by the way, recognises the corrupt archive as such and refuses to decompress it). The parsing logic is mostly from the before-times though (i.e., pre initial git commit), so it's difficult to distinguish intentional leniency and bugs.</p>
<h2>Afterword</h2>
<p>Incidentally, in investigating this I came across another bug. There is a helper function <code>panic_show_mem()</code> in the initramfs that's meant to dump memory information and then call <code>panic()</code>. It takes in standard <code>printf()</code> style format string and arguments, and tries to forward them to <code>panic()</code> which ultimately prints them.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">panic_show_mem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...)</span><span class="w"></span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>But variadic arguments don't quite work this way: instead of forwarding the list <code>args</code> as intended, <code>panic()</code> will instead interpret <code>args</code> as a single argument for the format string <code>fmt</code>. Standard library functions address this by providing <code>v*</code> variants of <code>printf()</code> and friends. For example,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fmt</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...);</span><span class="w"></span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>We might create a <code>vpanic()</code> function in the kernel that follows this style, but it seems easier to just make <code>panic_show_mem()</code> a macro and 'forward' the arguments in the source code</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">#define panic_show_mem(fmt, ...) \</span>
<span class="cp">    ({ show_mem(0, NULL); panic(fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__); })</span>
</code></pre></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you have POWER8 systems that you want to keep alive, what are your options in 2022?  You can keep using the legacy distribution you're still using as long as it's still supported, but if you want some modernisation, that might not be the best option for you.  Here's the current landscape of POWER8 support in major distributions, and hopefully it helps you out!</p>
<p>Please note that I am entirely focused on what runs and keeps getting new packages, not what companies will officially support.  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=lpo-supported-linux-distributions-virtualization-options-power8-power9-linux-power-systems">IBM provides documentation for that.</a>  I'm also mostly focused on OpenPOWER and not what's supported under IBM PowerVM.</p>
<p><strong>RHEL-compatible</strong></p>
<p>Things aren't too great on the RHEL-compatible side.  RHEL 9 is compiled with P9 instructions, removing support for P8.  This includes compatible distributions, like CentOS Stream and Rocky Linux.</p>
<p>You can continue to use RHEL 8 for a long time.  Unfortunately, Rocky Linux only has a Power release for EL9 and not EL8, and CentOS Stream 8 hits EOL May 31st, 2024 - a bit too soon for my liking.  If you're a RHEL customer though, you're set.</p>
<p><strong>Fedora</strong></p>
<p>Fedora seems like a great option - the latest versions still support P8 and there's no immediate signs of that changing.  The issue is that Fedora could change this with relatively little warning (and their big brother RHEL already has), Fedora doesn't provide LTS versions that will stay supported if this happens, and any options you could migrate to would be very different from what you're using.</p>
<p>For that reason, I don't recommend using Fedora on POWER8 if you intend to keep it around for a while.  If you want something modern for a short-term project, go right ahead!  Otherwise, I'd avoid it.  If you're still keeping POWER8 systems alive, you probably want something more set-and-forget than Fedora anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>Ubuntu is a mixed bag.  The good news is that Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is supported until mid-2025, and if you give Canonical money, that support can extend through 2030.  Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is my personal pick for the best distro to install on POWER8 systems that you want to have somewhat modern software but without the risks of future issues.</p>
<p>The bad news is that POWER8 support went away in Ubuntu 22.04, which is extremely unfortunate.  Missing an LTS cycle is one thing, but <em>not having a pathway from 21.10 is another</em>.  If you were on 20.10/21.04/21.10, you are completely boned, because they're all out of support and 22.04 and later don't support POWER8.  You're going to have to reinstall 20.04.</p>
<p>If I sound salty, it's because I had to do this for a few machines.  Hopefully you're not in that situation.  20.04 is going to be around for a good while longer, with a lot of modern creature comforts you'd miss on an EL8-compatible distro, so it's my pick for now.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSUSE</strong></p>
<p>I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to chameleon-flavoured distros, so take this with a grain of salt as most of it is from some quick searching.  OpenSUSE Leap follows SLES, but without extended support lifetimes for older major versions.  From what I can tell, the latest release (15.4) still includes POWER8 support (and adds Power10 support!), but similar to Fedora, that looks rather prone to a new version dropping P8 support to me.</p>
<p>If the 15.x series stayed alive after 16 came out, you might be good, but it doesn't seem like there's a history of that happening.</p>
<p><strong>Debian</strong></p>
<p>Debian 11 "bullseye" came out in 2021, supports POWER8, and is likely to be supported until around 2026.  I can't really chime in on more than that because I am a certified Debian hater (even newer releases feel outdated to me), but that looks like a pretty good deal.</p>
<p><strong>Other options</strong></p>
<p>Those are just some major distros, there's plenty of others, including some Power-specific ones from the community.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>POWER8's getting old, but is still plenty capable.  Make sure your distro still remembers to send your POWER8 a birthday card each year and you'll have plenty more good times to come.</p></div>

<time datetime="2022-10-26T16:30:00+11:00" pubdate>Wed 26 October 2022</time></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Linux 6.1-rc1 was tagged on October 16th, 2022 and includes a bunch of nice things from my team that I want to highlight.  Our goal is to make the Linux kernel running on IBM's Power CPUs more secure, and landed a few goodies upstream in 6.1 to that end.</p>
<p>Specifically, Linux 6.1 on Power will include <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=7e92e01b724526b98cbc7f03dd4afa0295780d56">a complete system call infrastructure rework with security <em>and</em> performance benefits</a>, <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=a5edf9815dd739fce660b4c8658f61b7d2517042">support for KFENCE (a low-overhead memory safety error detector)</a>, and <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=395cac7752b905318ae454a8b859d4c190485510">execute-only memory (XOM) support on the Radix MMU</a>.</p>
<p>The syscall work from Rohan McLure and Andrew Donnellan replaces arch/powerpc's legacy infrastructure with the syscall wrapper shared between architectures.  This was a significant overhaul of a lot of legacy code impacting all of powerpc's many platforms, including multiple different ABIs and 32/64bit compatibility infrastructure.  Rohan's series started at <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=302791&amp;state=*">v1 with 6 patches</a> and ended at <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=319348&amp;state=*">v6 with 25 patches</a>, and he's done an incredible job at adopting community feedback and handling new problems.</p>
<p>Big thanks to Christophe Leroy, Arnd Bergmann, Nick Piggin, Michael Ellerman and others for their reviews, and of course Andrew for providing a lot of review and feedback (and prototyping the syscall wrapper in the first place).  Our syscalls have entered the modern era, we can zeroise registers to improve security (but don't yet due to some ongoing discussion around compatibility and making it optional, look out for Linux 6.2), and gain a nice little performance boost by avoiding the allocation of a kernel stack frame.  For more detail, see <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/cover/20220921065605.1051927-1-rmclure@linux.ibm.com/">Rohan's cover letter</a>.</p>
<p>Next, we have Nicholas Miehlbradt's implementation of <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kfence.html">Kernel Electric Fence (KFENCE)</a> (and <code>DEBUG_PAGEALLOC</code>) for 64-bit Power, including the Hash and Radix MMUs.  Christophe Leroy has already implemented KFENCE for 32-bit powerpc upstream and a series adding support for 64-bit was posted by Jordan Niethe last year, but couldn't proceed due to locking issues.  Those issues have since been resolved, and after fixing a previously unknown and very obscure MM issue, Nick's KFENCE patches have been merged.</p>
<p>KFENCE is a low-overhead alternative to memory detectors like KASAN (<a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/powerpc/linux.git/commit/?id=41b7a347bf1491e7300563bb224432608b41f62a">which we implemented for Radix earlier this year, thanks to Daniel Axtens and Paul Mackerras</a>), which you probably wouldn't want to run in production.  If you're chasing a memory corruption bug that doesn't like to present itself, KFENCE can help you do that for out-of-bounds accesses, use-after-frees, double frees etc without significantly impacting performance.</p>
<p>Finally, I wired up execute-only memory (XOM) for the Radix MMU.  XOM is a niche feature that lets users map pages with <code>PROT_EXEC</code> only, creating a page that can't be read or written to, but still executed.  This is primarily useful for defending against code reuse attacks like ROP, but has other uses such as JIT/sandbox environments.  Power8 and later CPUs running the Hash MMU already had this capability through protection keys (pkeys), my implementation for Radix uses the native execute permission bit of the Radix MMU instead.</p>
<p>This basically took me an afternoon to wire up after I had the idea and I roped in Nicholas Miehlbradt to contribute a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/testing/selftests/powerpc/mm/exec_prot.c">selftest</a>, which ended up being a more significant engineering effort than the feature implementation itself.  We now have a comprehensive test for XOM that runs on both Hash and Radix for all possible combinations of R/W/X upstream.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's all I have - this is my first time writing a post like this, so let me know what you think!  A lot of our work doesn't result in upstream patches so we're not always going to have kernel releases as eventful as this, but we can post summaries every once in a while if there's interest.  Thanks for reading!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently a set of 8 vulnerabilities were disclosed for the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/GRUB2SecureBootBypass2021">grub bootloader</a>. I
found 2 of them (CVE-2021-20225 and CVE-2021-20233), and contributed a number of
other fixes for crashing bugs which we don't believe are exploitable. I found
them by applying fuzz testing to grub. Here's how.</p>
<p>This is a multi-part series: I think it will end up being 4 posts. I'm hoping to
cover:</p>
<ul>

<li>Part 2 (this post): going faster by doing lots more work</li>
<li>Part 3: fuzzing filesystems and more</li>
<li>Part 4: potential next steps and avenues for further work</li>
</ul>
<p>We've been looking at fuzzing <code>grub-emu</code>, which is basically most parts of grub
built into a standard userspace program. This includes all the script parsing
logic, fonts, graphics, partition tables, filesystems and so on - just not
platform specific driver code or the ability to actually load and boot a kernel.</p>
<p>Previously, we talked about some issues building grub with AFL++'s
instrumentation:</p>

<p>It also doesn't work with <code>afl-gcc</code>.</p>
<p>We tried to trick configure:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem is the module linkage that I talked about in <a href="/blog/2021/03/04/fuzzing-grub-part-1">part 1</a>.
There is a link stage of sorts for the kernel (<code>kernel.exec</code>) and each module
(e.g. <code>disk.module</code>), so some AFL support code gets linked into each of
those. Then there's another link stage for <code>grub-emu</code> itself, which also tries
to bring in the same support code. The linker doesn't like the symbols being in
multiple places, which is fair enough.</p>
<p>There are (at least) 3 ways you could solve this. I'm going to call them the hard way, and the ugly way and the easy way.</p>
<h2>The hard way: messing with makefiles</h2>
<p>We've been looking at fuzzing <code>grub-emu</code>. Building <code>grub-emu</code> links
<code>kernel.exec</code> and almost every <code>.module</code> file that grub produces into the
final binary. Maybe we could avoid our duplicate symbol problems entirely by
changing how we build things?</p>
<p>I didn't do this in my early work because, to be honest, I don't like working
with build systems and I'm not especially good at it. grub's build system is
based on autotools but is even more quirky than usual: rather than just having a
<code>Makefile.am</code>, we have <code>Makefile.core.def</code> which is used along with other things
to generate <code>Makefile.am</code>. It's a pretty cool system for making modules, but
it's not my idea of fun to work with.</p>
<p>But, for the sake of completeness, I tried again.</p>
<p>It gets unpleasant quickly. The generated <code>grub-core/Makefile.core.am</code> adds each module to <code>platform_PROGRAMS</code>, and then each is built with <code>LDFLAGS_MODULE = $(LDFLAGS_PLATFORM) -nostdlib $(TARGET_LDFLAGS_OLDMAGIC) -Wl,-r,-d</code>.</p>
<p>Basically, in the makefile this ends up being (e.g.):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">:::make</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nf">tar.module$(EXEEXT)</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">$(</span><span class="nv">tar_module_OBJECTS</span><span class="k">)</span> <span class="k">$(</span><span class="nv">tar_module_DEPENDENCIES</span><span class="k">)</span> <span class="k">$(</span><span class="nv">EXTRA_tar_module_DEPENDENCIES</span><span class="k">)</span> 
    @rm -f tar.module<span class="k">$(</span>EXEEXT<span class="k">)</span>
    <span class="k">$(</span>AM_V_CCLD<span class="k">)$(</span>tar_module_LINK<span class="k">)</span> <span class="k">$(</span>tar_module_OBJECTS<span class="k">)</span> <span class="k">$(</span>tar_module_LDADD<span class="k">)</span> <span class="k">$(</span>LIBS<span class="k">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ideally I don't want them to be linked at all; there's no benefit if
they're just going to be linked again.</p>
<p>You can't just collect the sources and build them into <code>grub-emu</code> - they all
have to built with different <code>CFLAGS</code>! So instead I spent some hours messing
around with the build system. Given some changes to the python script that
converts the <code>Makefile.*.def</code> files into <code>Makefile.am</code> files, plus some other
bits and pieces, we can build <code>grub-emu</code> by linking the object files rather than
the more-processed modules.</p>
<p>The build dies immediately after linking <code>grub-emu</code> in other components, and it
requires a bit of manual intervention to get the right things built in the right
order, but with all of those caveats, it's enough. It works, and you can turn on
things like ASAN, but getting there was hard, unrewarding and unpleasant. Let's
consider alternative ways to solve this problem.</p>
<h2>The ugly way: patching AFL</h2>
<p>What I did when finding the bugs was to observe that we only wanted AFL to link
in its extra instrumentation at certain points of the build process. So I
patched AFL to add an environment variable <code>AFL_DEFER_LIB</code> - which prevented AFL
adding its own instrumentation library when being called as a linker. I combined
this with the older CFG instrumentation, as the PCGUARD instrumentation brought
in a bunch of symbols from LLVM which I didn't want to also figure out how to
guard.</p>
<p>I then wrapped this in a horrifying script that basically built bits and pieces
of grub with the environment variable on or off, in order to at least get the
userspace tools and <code>grub-emu</code> built. Basically it set <code>AFL_DEFER_LIB</code> when
building all the modules and turned it off when building the userspace tools
and <code>grub-emu</code>.</p>
<p>This worked and it's what I used to find most of my bugs. But I'd probably not
recommend it, and I'm not sharing the source: it's extremely fragile and
brittle, the hard way is more generally applicable, and the easy way is nicer.</p>
<h2>The easy way: adjusting linker flags</h2>
<p>After posting part 1 of this series, I had a fascinating twitter DM conversation
with <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerschoice">@hackerschoice</a>, who pointed me to some
new work that had been done in AFL++ between when I started and when I published
part 1.</p>
<p>AFL++ now has the ability to dynamically detect some duplicate symbols, allowing
it to support plugins and modules better. This isn't directly applicable because
we link all the modules in at build time, but in the conversation I was pointed
to a linker flag which instructs the linker to ignore the symbol duplication
rather than error out. This provides a significantly simpler way to instrument
<code>grub-emu</code>, avoiding all the issues I'd previously been fighting so hard to
address.</p>
<p>So, with a modern AFL++, and the patch from <a href="https://github.com/daxtens/grub/tree/fuzzing-pt2">part 1</a>,
you can sort out this entire process like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell
./bootstrap
./configure --with-platform=emu CC=clang CXX=clang++ --disable-grub-emu-sdl
make CC=/path/to/afl-clang-fast LDFLAGS=&quot;-Wl,--allow-multiple-definition&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Eventually it will error out, but <code>./grub-core/grub-emu</code> should be successfully
built first.</p>
<p>(Why not just build <code>grub-emu</code> directly? It gets built by <code>grub-core/Makefile</code>,
but depends on a bunch of things made by the top-level makefile and doesn't
express its dependencies well. So you can try to build all the things that you
need separately and then <code>cd grub-core; make ...flags... grub-emu</code> if you want -
but it's way more complicated to do it that way!)</p>
<h1>Going extra fast: <code>__AFL_INIT</code></h1>
<p>Now that we can compile with instrumentation, we can use <code>__AFL_INIT</code>. I'll
leave the precise details of how this works to the AFL docs, but in short it
allows us to do a bunch of early setup only once, and just fork the process
after the setup is done.</p>
<p>There's a patch that inserts a call to <code>__AFL_INIT</code> in the <code>grub-emu</code> start path
in <a href="https://github.com/daxtens/grub/tree/fuzzing-pt2">my GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>All up, this can lead to a 2x-3x speedup over the figures I saw in <a href="/blog/2021/03/04/fuzzing-grub-part-1">part 1</a>.
In part 1 we saw around 244 executions per second at this point - now we're over
500:</p>
<p><img alt="afl-fuzz fuzzing grub, showing fuzzing happening" src="/images/dja/grub-fuzzing-pt2.png"></p>
<h1>Finding more bugs with sanitisers</h1>
<p>A 'sanitizer' refers to a set of checks inserted by a compiler at build time to
detect various runtime issues that might not cause a crash or otherwise be
detected. A particularly common and useful sanitizer is ASAN, the
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">AddressSanitizer</a>, which
detects out-of-bounds memory accesses, use-after-frees and other assorted memory
bugs. Other sanitisers can check for
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html">undefined behaviour</a>,
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html">uninitialised memory reads</a>
or even breaches of
<a href="https://releases.llvm.org/12.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html">control flow integrity</a>.</p>
<p>ASAN is particularly popular for fuzzing. In theory, compiling with AFL++ and
LLVM makes it really easy to compile with ASAN. Setting <code>AFL_USE_ASAN=1</code> should
be sufficient.</p>
<p>However, in practice, it's quite fragile for grub. I believe I had it all
working, and then I upgraded my distro, LLVM and AFL++ versions, and everything
stopped working. (It's possible that I hadn't sufficiently cleaned my source
tree and I was still building based on the hard way? Who knows.)</p>
<p>I spent quite a while fighting "truncated relocations". ASAN instrumentation was
bloating the binaries, and the size of all the <code>*.module</code> files was over 512MB,
which I suspect was causing the issues. (Without ASAN, it only comes to 35MB.)</p>
<p>I tried <code>afl-clang-lto</code>: I installed <code>lld</code>, rebuilt AFL++, and managed to
segfault the linker while building grub. So I wrote that off. Changing the
instrumentation type to classic didn't help either.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.technovelty.org/c/relocation-truncated-to-fit-wtf.html">Some googling</a>
suggested GCC's <code>-mmodel</code>, which in Clang seems to be <code>-mcmodel</code>, but
<code>CFLAGS="-mcmodel=large"</code> didn't get me any further either: it's already added
in a few different links.</p>
<p>My default llvm is llvm-12, so I tried building with llvm-9 and llvm-11 in case
that helped. Both built a binary, but it would fail to start:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">:::</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="w"></span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The same happens if I build with llvm-12 and <code>afl-clang</code>, the old-style
instrumentation.</p>
<p>I spun up a Ubuntu 20.04 VM and build there with LLVM 10 and the latest stable
AFL++. That didn't work either.</p>
<p>I had much better luck using GCC's and GCC's ASAN implementation, either with
the old-school <code>afl-gcc</code> or the newer GCC plugin-based <code>afl-gcc-fast</code>. (I have
some hypotheses around shared library vs static library ASAN, but having spent
way more work time on this than was reasonable, I was disinclined to debug it
further.) Here's what worked for me:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">:::</span><span class="n">shell</span><span class="w"></span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>GCC doesn't support as many sanitisers as LLVM, but happily it does support
ASAN. AFL++'s GCC plugin mode should get us most of the speed we would get from
LLVM, and indeed the speed - even with ASAN - is quite acceptable.</p>
<p>If you persist, you should be able to find some more bugs: for example there's a
very boring global array out-of-bounds read when parsing config files.</p>
<p>That's all for part 2. In part 3 we'll look at fuzzing filesystems and
more. Hopefully there will be a quicker turnaround between part 2 and part 3
than there was between part 1 and part 2!</p></div>

other fixes for crashing bugs which we don't believe are exploitable. I found
them by applying fuzz testing to grub. Here's how.</p>
<p>This is a multi-part series: I think it will end up being 4 posts. I'm hoping to
cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 (this post): getting started with fuzzing grub</li>
<li>Part 2: <a href="/blog/2021/06/14/fuzzing-grub-part-2-going-faster/">going faster by doing lots more work</a></li>

<li>Part 4: potential next steps and avenues for further work</li>
</ul>
<h1>Fuzz testing</h1>
<p>Let's begin with part one: getting started with fuzzing grub.</p>
<p>One of my all-time favourite techniques for testing programs, especially
programs that handle untrusted input, and especially-especially programs written
in C that parse untrusted input, is fuzz testing. Fuzz testing (or fuzzing) is
the process of repeatedly throwing randomised data at your program under test
and seeing what it does.</p>
<p>(For the secure boot threat model, untrusted input is anything not validated by
a cryptographic signature - so config files are untrusted for our purposes, but
grub modules can only be loaded if they are signed, so they are trusted.)</p>
<p>Fuzzing has a long history and has recently received a new lease on life with
coverage-guided fuzzing tools like <a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">AFL</a> and
more recently <a href="https://aflplus.plus/">AFL++</a>.</p>
<h1>Building grub for AFL++</h1>
<p>AFL++ is extremely easy to use ... if your program:</p>
<ol>
<li>is built as a single binary with a regular tool-chain</li>
<li>runs as a regular user-space program on Linux</li>
<li>reads a small input files from disk and then exits</li>
<li>doesn't do anything fancy with threads or signals</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond that, it gets a bit more complex.</p>
<p>On the face of it, grub fails 3 of these 4 criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>grub is a highly modular program: it loads almost all of its functionality as
   modules which are linked as separate ELF relocatable files. (Not runnable
   programs, but not shared libraries either.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grub usually runs as a bootloader, not as a regular app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>grub reads all sorts of things, ranging in size from small files to full
   disks. After loading most things, it returns to a command prompt rather than
   exiting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, these problems are not insurmountable.</p>
<p>We'll start with the 'running as a bootloader' problem. Here, grub helps us out
a bit, because it provides an 'emulator' target, which runs most of grub
functionality as a userspace program. It doesn't support actually booting
anything (unsurprisingly) but it does support most other modules, including
things like the config file parser.</p>
<p>We can configure grub to build the emulator. We disable the graphical frontend
for now.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell
./bootstrap
./configure --with-platform=emu --disable-grub-emu-sdl
</code></pre></div>

<p>At this point in building a fuzzing target, we'd normally try to configure with
<code>afl-cc</code> to get the instrumentation that makes AFL(++) so powerful. However, the
grub configure script is not a fan:</p>

<p>It also doesn't work with <code>afl-gcc</code>.</p>
<p>Hmm, ok, so what if we just... lie a bit?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell

<p>(Normally I'd use <code>CC=clang</code> and <code>afl-cc</code>, but clang support is slightly broken
upstream at the moment.)</p>
<p>After a small fix for gcc-10 compatibility, we get the userspace tools
(potentially handy!) but a bunch of link errors for <code>grub-emu</code>:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The problem is the module linkage that I talked about earlier: because there is
a link stage of sorts for each module, some AFL support code gets linked in to
both the grub kernel (<code>kernel.exec</code>) and each module (here <code>disk.module</code>,
<code>regexp.module</code>, ...). The linker doesn't like it being in both, which is fair
enough.</p>
<p>To get started, let's instead take advantage of the smarts of AFL++ using Qemu
mode instead. This builds a specially instrumented qemu user-mode emulator
that's capable of doing coverage-guided fuzzing on uninstrumented binaries at
the cost of a significant performance penalty.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell
make clean
make
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we have a grub-emu binary. If you run it directly, you'll pick up your
system boot configuration, but the <code>-d</code> option can point it to a directory of
your choosing. Let's set up one for fuzzing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell
mkdir stage
echo &quot;echo Hello sthbrx readers&quot; &gt; stage/grub.cfg
cd stage
../grub-core/grub-emu -d .
</code></pre></div>

<p>You probably won't see the message because the screen gets blanked at the end of
running the config file, but if you pipe it through <code>less</code> or something you'll
see it.</p>
<h1>Running the fuzzer</h1>
<p>So, that seems to work - let's create a test input and try fuzzing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::<span class="nv">shell</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nv">cd</span><span class="w"> </span>..<span class="w"></span>
<span class="nv">mkdir</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">in</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="nv">echo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;echo hi&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">in</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nv">echo</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">hi</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="nv">cd</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">stage</span><span class="w"></span>
#<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">Q</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">qemu</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">mode</span><span class="w"></span>

#<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nv">d</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">don</span><span class="err">&#39;t do deterministic steps (too slow for a text format)</span>
<span class="err"># -f create file grub.cfg</span>
<span class="err">$AFL_PATH/afl-fuzz -Q -i ../in -o ../out -M main -d -- ../grub-core/grub-emu -d .</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sadly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">:::text</span>
<span class="k">[</span><span class="nb">-</span><span class="k">]</span><span class="c"> The program took more than 1000 ms to process one of the initial test cases</span><span class="nt">.</span><span class="c"></span>
<span class="c">    This is bad news; raising the limit with the </span><span class="nb">-</span><span class="c">t option is possible</span><span class="nt">,</span><span class="c"> but</span>
<span class="c">    will probably make the fuzzing process extremely slow</span><span class="nt">.</span><span class="c"></span>

<span class="c">    If this test case is just a fluke</span><span class="nt">,</span><span class="c"> the other option is to just avoid it</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>What we're seeing here (and indeed what you can observe if you run <code>grub-emu</code>
directly) is that <code>grub-emu</code> isn't exiting when it's done. It's waiting for more
input, and will keep waiting for input until it's killed by <code>afl-fuzz</code>.</p>
<p>We need to patch grub to sort that out. It's on <a href="https://github.com/daxtens/grub/commit/ad2e84224e674eb1f9dcd8efc3d8efe78ed62bec">my GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Apply that, rebuild with <code>FUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION</code>, and voila:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell
cd ..
make CFLAGS=&quot;-DFUZZING_BUILD_MODE_UNSAFE_FOR_PRODUCTION&quot;
cd stage
$AFL_PATH/afl-fuzz -Q -i ../in -o ../out -M main -d -f grub.cfg -- ../grub-core/grub-emu -d .
</code></pre></div>

<p>And fuzzing is happening!</p>
<p><img alt="afl-fuzz fuzzing grub, showing fuzzing happening" src="/images/dja/grub-fuzzing-pt1.png"></p>
<p>This is enough to find some of the (now-fixed) bugs in the grub config file
parsing!</p>
<h1>Fuzzing beyond the config file</h1>
<p>You can also extend this to fuzzing other things that don't require the
graphical UI, such as grub's transparent decompression support:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell
cd ..
rm -rf in out stage
mkdir in stage
echo hi &gt; in/hi
gzip in/hi
cd stage
echo &quot;cat thefile&quot; &gt; grub.cfg
$AFL_PATH/afl-fuzz -Q -i ../in -o ../out -M main -f thefile -- ../grub-core/grub-emu -d .
</code></pre></div>

<p>You should be able to find a hang pretty quickly with this, an as-yet-unfixed
bug where grub will print output forever from a corrupt file: (your mileage may
vary, as will the paths.)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::shell
cp ../out/main/hangs/id:000000,src:000000,time:43383,op:havoc,rep:16 thefile
../grub-core/grub-emu -d . | less # observe this going on forever
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>zcat</code>, on the other hand, reports it as simply corrupt:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>:::text
$ zcat thefile

gzip: thefile: invalid compressed data--format violated
</code></pre></div>

<p>(Feel free to fix that and send a patch to the list!)</p>
<p>That wraps up part 1. Eventually I'll be back with part 2, where I explain the
hoops to jump through to go faster with the <code>afl-cc</code> instrumentation.</p></div>
