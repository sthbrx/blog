  <div class="entry-content"><p>It started off a regular Wednesday morning when I hear from my desk a colleague
muttering about doubles and their hex representation. "But that doesn't look
right", "How do I read this as a float", and "<del>redacted</del> you're the engineer,
you do it". My interest piqued, I headed over to his desk to enquire about the
great un-solvable mystery of the double and its hex representation. The number
which would consume me for the rest of the morning: 0xc00000001568fba0.</p>
<h1>That's a Perfectly Valid hex Number!</h1>
<p>I hear you say. And you're right, if we were to simply treat this as a long it
would simply be 13835058055641365408 (or -4611686018068186208 if we assume
a signed value). But we happen to know that this particular piece of data which
we have printed is supposed to represent a double (-2 to be precise). "Well
print it as a double" I hear from the back, and once again we <em>should</em> all know
that this can be achieved rather easily by using the %f/%e/%g specifiers in our
print statement. The only problem is that in kernel land (where we use printk)
we are limited to printing fixed point numbers, hence why our only <em>easy</em>
option was to print our double in it's raw hex format.</p>
<p>This is the point where we all think back to that university course where
number representations were covered in depth, and terms like mantissa and
exponent surface in our minds. Of course as we rack our brains we realise
there's no way that we're going to remember exactly how a double is represented
and bring up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">IEEE 754 Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<h1>What is a Double?</h1>
<p>Taking a step back for a second a double (or a double-precision floating-point)
is a number format used to represent floating-point numbers (those with a
decimal component). They are made up of a sign bit, an exponent and a fraction
(or mantissa):</p>
<p><img alt="Double Format" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/double.png" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format" /></p>
<p>Where the number they represent is defined by:</p>
<p><img alt="Double Formula" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/formula.png" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format" /></p>
<p>So this means that a 1 in the MSB (sign bit) represents a negative number, and
we have some decimal component (the fraction) which we multiply by some power
of 2 (as determined by the exponent) to get our value.</p>
<h1>Alright, so what's 0xc00000001568fba0?</h1>
<p>The reason we're all here to be begin with, so what's 0xc00000001568fba0 if we
treat it as a double? We can first split it into the three components:</p>
<h3>0xc00000001568fba0:</h3>
<p>Sign bit: 1             -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400         -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x1568fba0    -&gt; 1.<em>something</em><br></p>
<p>And then use the formula above to get our number:</p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>something</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup></p>
<p><strong>But there's a much easier way!</strong> Just write ourselves a little program in
userspace (where we are capable of printing floats) and we can save ourselves
<em>most</em> of the trouble.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xc00000001568fba0</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: %lf</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So all we're doing is taking our hex value and storing it in a long (val), then
getting a pointer to val, casting it to a double pointer, and dereferencing it
and printing it as a float. <em><strong>Drum Roll</strong></em> And the answer is?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: -2.000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Wait a minute, that doesn't quite sound right". You're right, it does seem a
bit strange that this is exactly -2. Well it may be that we are not printing
enough decimal places to see the full result, so update our print statement to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: %.64lf</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And now we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: -2.0000001595175973534423974342644214630126953125000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much better... But still where did this number come from and why wasn't it the
-2 that we were expecting?</p>
<h1>Kernel Pointers</h1>
<p>At this point suspicions had been raised that what was being printed by my
colleague was not what he expected and that this was in fact a Kernel pointer.
How do you know? Lets take a step back for a second...</p>
<p>In the PowerPC architecture, the address space which can be seen by an
application is known as the <em>effective</em> address space. We can take this
and translate it into a <em>virtual</em> address which when passed through the
HPT gives us a <em>real</em> address (or the hardware memory address).</p>
<p>The <em>effective</em> address space is divided into 5 regions:</p>
<p><a href="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/effective_address.png" title="https://www.kernel.org/doc/ols/2001/ppc64.pdf">02</a></p>
<p>As you may notice, Kernel addresses begin with 0xc. This has the advantage that
we can map a <em>virtual</em> address without the need for a table by simply
masking the top nibble.</p>
<p>Thus it would be reasonable to assume that our value (0xc00000001568fba0) was
indeed a pointer to a Kernel address (and further code investigation confirmed
this).</p>
<h1>But What is -2 as a Double in hex?</h1>
<p>Well lets modify the above program and find out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">include</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">stdio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>

        <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: 0x%lx</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">long</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Result?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: 0xc000000000000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that sounds much better. Lets take a closer look:</p>
<h3>0xc000000000000000:</h3>
<p>Sign Bit: 1     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400 -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x0   -&gt; Zero<br></p>
<p>So if you remember from above, we have:</p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>0</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -2</p>
<p>What about -1? -3?</p>
<h2>-1:</h2>
<h3>0xbff0000000000000:</h3>
<p>Sign Bit: 1     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x3ff -&gt; 2<sup>(1023 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x0   -&gt; Zero<br></p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>0</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1023 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -1</p>
<h2>-3:</h2>
<h3>0xc008000000000000:</h3>
<p>Sign Bit: 1                     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400                 -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x8000000000000       -&gt; 0.5<br></p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>5</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -3</p>
<h1>So What Have We Learnt?</h1>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, make sure that what you're printing is what you think you're printing.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, if it looks like a Kernel pointer then you're probably not printing
what you think you're printing.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, all Kernel pointers ~= -2 if you treat them as a double.</p>
<p>And <strong>Finally</strong>, <em>with my morning gone</em>, I can say for certain that if we treat it as
a double, 0xc00000001568fba0 =
-2.0000001595175973534423974342644214630126953125.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here at OzLabs, we have an unfortunate habit of making our shiny Power computers very sad, which is a common problem in systems programming and kernel hacking. When this happens, we like having logs. In particular, we like to have the kernel log and the OPAL firmware log, which are, very surprisingly, rather helpful when debugging kernel and firmware issues.</p>
<p>Here's how to get them.</p>
<h2>From userspace</h2>
<p>You're lucky enough that your machine is still up, yay! As every Linux sysadmin knows, you can just grab the kernel log using <code>dmesg</code>.</p>
<p>As for the OPAL log: we can simply ask OPAL to tell us where its log is located in memory, copy it from there, and hand it over to userspace. In Linux, as per standard Unix conventions, we do this by exposing the log as a file, which can be found in <code>/sys/firmware/opal/msglog</code>.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, the <code>msglog</code> file reports itself as size 0 (I'm not sure exactly why, but I <em>think</em> it's due to limitations in sysfs), so if you try to copy the file with <code>cp</code>, you end up with just a blank file. However, you can read it with <code>cat</code> or <code>less</code>.</p>
<h2>From <code>xmon</code></h2>
<p><code>xmon</code> is a really handy in-kernel debugger for PowerPC that allows you to do basic debugging over the console without hooking up a second machine to use with <code>kgdb</code>. On our development systems, we often configure <code>xmon</code> to automatically begin debugging whenever we hit an oops or panic (using <code>xmon=on</code> on the kernel command line, or the <code>XMON_DEFAULT</code> Kconfig option). It can also be manually triggered:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>root@p86:~# echo x &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger
sysrq: SysRq : Entering xmon
cpu 0x7: Vector: 0  at [c000000fcd717a80]

enter ? for help
7:mon&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>From <code>xmon</code>, simply type <code>dl</code> to dump out the kernel log. If you'd like to page through the log rather than dump the entire thing at once, use <code>#&lt;n&gt;</code> to split it into groups of <code>n</code> lines.</p>
<p>Until recently, it wasn't as easy to extract the OPAL log without knowing magic offsets. A couple of months ago, I was debugging a nasty CAPI issue and got rather frustrated by this, so one day when I had a couple of hours free I <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/581775/">refactored</a> the existing sysfs interface and <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/581774/">added</a> the <code>do</code> command to <code>xmon</code>. These patches will be included from kernel 4.6-rc1 onwards.</p>
<p>When you're done, <code>x</code> will attempt to recover the machine and continue, <code>zr</code> will reboot, and <code>zh</code> will halt.</p>
<h2>From the FSP</h2>
<p>Sometimes, not even <code>xmon</code> will help you. In production environments, you're not generally going to start a debugger every time you have an incident. Additionally, a serious hardware error can cause a 'checkstop', which completely halts the system. (Thankfully, end users don't see this very often, but kernel developers, on the other hand...)</p>
<p>This is where the Flexible Service Processor, or FSP, comes in. The FSP is an IBM-developed baseboard management controller used on most IBM-branded Power Systems machines, and is responsible for a whole range of things, including monitoring system health. Among its many capabilities, the FSP can automatically take "system dumps" when fatal errors occur, capturing designated regions of memory for later debugging. System dumps can be configured and triggered via the FSP's web interface, which is beyond the scope of this post but is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER8/p8ha5/mainstoragedump.htm?cp=POWER8%2F1-3-14-2">documented</a> in IBM Power Systems user manuals.</p>
<p>How does the FSP know what to capture? As it turns out, skiboot (the firmware which implements OPAL) maintains a <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/blob/master/hw/fsp/fsp-mdst-table.c">Memory Dump Source Table</a> which tells the FSP which memory regions to dump. MDST updates are recorded in the OPAL log:</p>

<p>In the above log, we see four entries: the skiboot/OPAL log, the <a href="https://github.com/open-power/hostboot">hostboot</a> runtime log, the petitboot Linux kernel log (which doesn't make it into the final dump) and the real Linux kernel log. skiboot obviously adds the OPAL and hostboot logs to the MDST early in boot, but it also exposes the <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/blob/master/doc/opal-api/opal-register-dump-region-101.txt"><code>OPAL_REGISTER_DUMP_REGION</code></a> call which can be used by the operating system to register additional regions. Linux uses this to <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/opal.c#L608">register the kernel log buffer</a>. If you're a kernel developer, you could potentially use the OPAL call to register your own interesting bits of memory.</p>
<p>So, the MDST is all set up, we go about doing our business, and suddenly we checkstop. The FSP does its sysdump magic and a few minutes later it reboots the system. What now?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After we come back up, the FSP notifies OPAL that a new dump is available. Linux exposes the dump to userspace under <code>/sys/firmware/opal/dump/</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I've only been working on the Linux kernel for a few months.  Before that, I worked with proprietary source control at work and common tools like GitHub at home.  The concept of the mailing list seemed obtuse to me.  If I noticed a problem with some program, I'd be willing to open an issue on GitHub but not to send an email to a mailing list.  Who still uses those, anyway?</p>
<p>Starting out with the kernel meant I had to figure this email thing out.  <code>git format-patch</code> and <code>git send-email</code> take most of the pain out of formatting and submitting a patch, which is nice.  The patch files generated by <code>format-patch</code> open nicely in Emacs by default, showing all whitespace and letting you pick up any irregularities.  <code>send-email</code> means you can send it to yourself or a friend first, finding anything that looks stupid before being exposed to the public.</p>
<p>And then what?  You've sent an email.  It gets sent to hundreds or thousands of people.  Nowhere near that many will read it.  Some might miss it due to their mail server going down, or the list flagging your post as spam, or requiring moderation.  Some recipients will be bots that archive mail on the list, or publish information about the patch.  If you haven't formatted it correctly, someone will let you know quickly.  If your patch is important or controversial, you'll have all sorts of responses.  If your patch is small or niche, you might not ever hear anything back.</p>
<p>I remember when I sent my first patch.  I was talking to a former colleague who didn't understand the patch/mailing list workflow at all.  I sent him a link to my patch on a mail archive.  I explained it like a pull request - here's my code, you can find the responses.  What's missing from a GitHub-esque pull request?  We don't know what tests it passed.  We don't know if it's been merged yet, or if the maintainer has looked at it.  It takes a bit of digging around to find out who's commented on it.  If it's part of a series, that's awkward to find out as well.  What about revisions of a series?  That's another pain point.</p>
<p>Luckily, these problems do have solutions.  <a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">Patchwork</a>, written by fellow OzLabs member <a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org">Jeremy Kerr</a>, changes the way we work with patches.  Project maintainers rely on Pathwork instances, such as <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org">https://patchwork.ozlabs.org</a>, for their day-to-day workflow: tagging reviewers, marking the status of patches, keeping track of tests, acks, reviews and comments in one place.  Missing from this picture is support for series and revisions, which is a feature that's being developed by the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/">freedesktop</a> project.  You can check out their changes in action <a href="https://patchwork.freedesktop.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, Patchwork helps patches and email catch up to what GitHub has in terms of ease of information.  We're still missing testing and other hooks.  What about review?  What can we do with email, compared to GitHub and the like?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the biggest feature of email is the ease of review.  Just reply inline and you're done.  There's inline commenting on GitHub and GitLab, which works well but is a bit tacky, people commenting on the same thing overlap and conflict, each comment generates a notification (which can be an email until you turn that off).  Plus, since it's email, it's really easy to bring in additional people to the conversation as necessary.  If there's a super lengthy technical discussion in the kernel, it might just take Linus to resolve.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to just replying to email, too, such as <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a>.  Gerrit's pretty popular, and has a huge amount of features.  I understand why people use it, though I'm not much of a fan.  Reason being, it doesn't add to the email workflow, it replaces it.  Plaintext email is supported on pretty much any device, with a bunch of different programs.  From the goals of Patchwork: "patchwork should supplement mailing lists, not replace them".</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds famously explained why he prefers email over GitHub pull requests <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17">here</a>, using <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/linux.kernel/w957vpu3PPU">this</a> pull request from Ben Herrenschmidt as an example of why git's own pull request format is superior to that of GitHub.  Damien Lespiau, who is working on the freedesktop Patchwork fork, <a href="http://damien.lespiau.name/2016/02/augmenting-mailing-lists-with-patchwork.html">outlines on his blog</a> all the issues he has with mailing list workflows and why he thinks mailing lists are a relic of the past.  His work on Patchwork has gone a long way to help fix those problems, however I don't think mailing lists are outdated and superceded, I think they are timeless.  They are a technology-agnostic, simple and free system that will still be around if GitHub dies or alienates its community.</p>
<p>That said, there's still the case of the missing features.  What about automated testing?  What about developer feedback?  What about making a maintainer's life easier?  We've been working on improving these issues, and I'll outline how we're approaching them in a future post.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In POWER land <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a> is mostly known as the method to access the machine's console and start interacting with Petitboot. However it also has a plethora of other features, handily described in the 600ish page <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/ipmi-second-gen-interface-spec-v2-rev1-1.html">IPMI specification</a> (which you can go read yourself).</p>
<p>One especially relevant feature to Petitboot however is the 'chassis bootdev' command, which you can use to tell Petitboot to ignore any existing boot order, and only consider boot options of the type you specify (eg. 'network', 'disk', or 'setup' to not boot at all). Support for this has been in Petitboot for a while and should work on just about any machine you can get your hands on.</p>
<h2>Network Overrides</h2>
<p>Over in OpenPOWER<sup>1</sup> land however, someone took this idea and pushed it further - why not allow the network configuration to be overwritten too? This isn't in the IPMI spec, but if you cast your gaze down to page 398 where the spec lays out the entire format of the IPMI request, there is a certain field named "OEM Parameters". This is an optional amount of space set aside for whatever you like, which in this case is going to be data describing an override of the network config.</p>
<p>This allows a user to tell Petitboot over IPMI to either;</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the network completely,</li>
<li>Set a particular interface to use DHCP, or</li>
<li>Set a particular interface to use a specific static configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these options will cause any existing network configurations to be ignored.</p>
<h2>Building the Request</h2>
<p>Since this is an OEM-specific command, your average ipmitool package isn't going to have a nice way of making this request, such as 'chassis bootdev network'. Rather you need to do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">ipmitool -I lanplus -H </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">yourbmc</span><span class="x"> -U </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">user</span><span class="x"> -P </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">pass</span><span class="x"> raw 0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80 0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21 0x00 0x01 0x06 0x04 0xf4 0x52 0x14 0xf3 0x01 0xdf 0x00 0x01 0x0a 0x3d 0xa1 0x42 0x10 0x0a 0x3d 0x2 0x1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Horrific right? In the near future the Petitboot tree will include a helper program to format this request for you, but in the meantime (and for future reference), lets lay out how to put this together:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>Specify the &quot;chassis bootdev&quot; command, field 96, data field 1:
    0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80

Unique value that Petitboot recognises:
    0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21

Version field (1)
    0x00 0x01 ..   ..

Size of the hardware address (6):
    ..   ..   0x06 ..

Size of the IP address (IPv4/IPv6):
    ..   ..   ..   0x04

Hardware (MAC) address:
    0xf4 0x52 0x14 0xf3
    0x01 0xdf ..   ..

&#39;Ignore flag&#39; and DHCP/Static flag (DHCP is 0)
    ..   ..   0x00 0x01

(Below fields only required if setting a static IP)

IP Address:
    0x0a 0x3d 0xa1 0x42

Subnet Mask (eg, /16):
    0x10 ..   ..   ..
Gateway IP Address:
    ..   0x0a 0x3d 0x02
    0x01
</pre></div>


<p>Clearing a network override is as simple as making a request empty aside from the header:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80 0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00
</pre></div>


<p>You can also read back the request over IPMI with this request:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>0x00 0x09 0x61 0x00 0x00
</pre></div>


<p>That's it! Ideally this is something you would be scripting rather than bashing out on the keyboard - the main use case at the moment is as a way to force a machine to netboot against a known good source, rather than whatever may be available on its other interfaces.</p>
<p>[1] The reason this is only available on OpenPOWER machines at the moment is that support for the IPMI command itself depends on the BMC firmware, and non-OpenPOWER machines use an FSP which is a different platform.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In early February I had the opportunity to go the the NICTA Systems Summer School, where Cyril and I were invited to represent IBM. There were a number of excellent talks across a huge range of systems related subjects, but the one that has stuck with me the most was a talk given by <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/">Luis Ceze</a>  on a topic called approximate computing. So here, in hopes that you too find it interesting, is a brief run-down on what I learned.</p>
<p>Approximate computing is fundamentally about trading off accuracy for something else - often speed or power consumption. Initially this sounded like a very weird proposition: computers do things like 'running your operating system' and 'reading from and writing to disks': things you need to always be absolutely correct if you want anything vaguely resembling reliability. It turns out that this is actually not as big a roadblock as I had assumed - you can work around it fairly easily.</p>
<p>The model proposed for approximate computing is as follows. You divide your computation up into two classes: 'precise', and 'approximate'. You use 'precise' computations when you need to get exact answers: so for example if you are constructing a JPEG file, you want the JPEG header to be exact. Then you have approximate computations: so for example the contents of your image can be approximate.</p>
<p>For correctness, you have to establish some boundaries: you say that precise data can be used in approximate calculations, but that approximate data isn't allowed to cross back over and pollute precise calculations. This, while intuitively correct, poses some problems in practise: when you want to write out your approximate JPEG data, you need an operation that allows you to 'bless' (or in their terms 'endorse') some approximate data so it can be used in the precise file system operations.</p>
<p>In the talk we were shown an implementation of this model in Java, called <a href="http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/research/approximation/enerj.html">EnerJ</a>. EnerJ allows you to label variables with either <code>@Precise</code> if you're dealing with precise data, or <code>@Approx</code> if you're dealing with approximate data. The compiler was modified so that it would do all sorts of weird things when it knew it was dealing with approximate data: for example, drop loop iterations entirely, do things in entirely non-determistic ways - all sorts of fun stuff. It turns out this works surprisingly well.</p>
<p>However, the approximate computing really shines when you can bring it all the way down to the hardware level. The first thing they tried was a CPU with both 'approximate' and precise execution engines, but this turned out not to have the power savings hoped for. What seemed to work really well was a model where some approximate calculations could be identified ahead of time, and then replaced with neural networks in hardware. These neural networks approximated the calculations, but did so at significantly lower power levels. This sounded like a really promising concept, and it will be interesting to see if this goes anywhere over the next few years.</p>
<p>There's a lot of work evaluating the quality of the approximate result, for cases where the set of inputs is known, and when the inputs is not known. This is largely beyond my understanding, so I'll simply refer you to some of the papers <a href="http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/research/approximation/enerj.html">listed on the website</a>.</p>
<p>The final thing covered in the talk was bringing approximate computing into current paradigms by just being willing to accept higher user-visible error rates. For example, they hacked up a network stack to accept packets with invalid checksums. This has had mixed results so far. A question I had (but didn't get around to asking!) would be whether the mathematical properties of checksums (i.e. that they can correct a certain number of bit errors) could be used to correct some of the errors, rather than just accepting/rejecting them blindly. Perhaps by first attempting to correct errors using the checksums, we will be able to fix the simpler errors, reducing the error rate visible to the user.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the NICTA Systems Summer School to be a really interesting experience (and I hope to blog more about it soon). If you're a university student in Australia, or an academic, see if you can make it in 2017!</p></div>
